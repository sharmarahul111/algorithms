# Primes
Computing and analyzing first N prime numbers
Current status: 20M in ~10 minutes (in C)
## TODO:
- A program which starts where it left computing primes
- efficient storage of the primes (in binary)
- better charts
  - analyze the data of primes in various graphs
  - logs, diffs, number of primes, etc
  - try to see the nature of primes

- compute upto 100M primes somehow
- learn a better approach to do that
